Roleplay Advanced Dynamic Playlists

Ever had a cool song you want to play during your RPG session, but it didn't really fit any of your music playlists? Ever felt like you were missing a hyperspecific playlist to go with the unique mood at the table, or simply that you forgot a really obvious playlist you should have known you would have needed? Say goodbye to your boring old static playlists!

With RADPlaylists, you can create a database of songs, give each ratings in 5 different areas (Energy, Size, Gloom, Mystery and Danger), and dynamically choose songs on the fly queuing the music database for exactly the type of songs that you need in that moment. Simple day in the village? Keep everything low, just a bit of energy and size based on the town you are in. Epic boss fight with an eldritch horror that is about to end the world? Kick everything up to 11! Just kidding, ratings are meant to go up to 5, you get the gist though.
